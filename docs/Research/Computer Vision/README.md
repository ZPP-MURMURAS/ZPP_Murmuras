# Computer Vision in our project
With the current approach, we need to do a lot of preprocessing on a data that had to be extracted from the images of user's screen.\
And yet, we still aim to use ML model/s to later process this data even further. 
My idea was to switch to computer vision (mainly Image-text-to-text models).
Notebook/s in this folder represent my research on the topic.
