    "OmniParser was the first model that I tested. My impressions after playing with its demo were grand (you can find it here: https://huggingface.co/spaces/microsoft/OmniParser); after providing it with a picture of Lidl's promo magazine, it was able to extract text from it with very high precision. Additionally, because it wasn't parsing any XML trees, output was very clear; as a result I got a list of extracted strings and a list of their bounding boxes. Using clustering or even simple algorithms to bind together close elements could provide us with a very clean data that later BERT model could easily label. \\\n",
    "Problems arise with the deployment of the model. As of today (12.11.24) I couldn't find any official data regarding the number of params of the model. Additionally, its deployment on a local machine is non-trivial: it's huggingface page doesn't hold all necessary files, so to run the model, you have to clone the github repo AND THEN download files from the huggingface page. And when I finally managed to do that, I found that this model can't be run without NVIDIA GPU drivers (I'm using an AMD GPU). \\\n",
    "In conclusion, I think that OmniParser could prove very useful to us, but we won't be able to deploy it to the mobile."

Additionally, it's supposed to be easily configurable to be smaller (on its official page it is said that it can be easily distilled). Sadly, I didn't find any examples of that other than HF tutotial on distilling Vision models (can be found here: https://github.com/johko/computer-vision-course/blob/main/notebooks/Unit%203%20-%20Vision%20Transformers/KnowledgeDistillation.ipynb).

    "Another issue is that this model is, at the end of the day, too dumb for our needs. You can play with it safely on its demo page, and you will probably quickly notice that while it responds very well to prompts like \"Describe me this\", modifying the prompt to something like \"Describe me this AS json\" will cause the model to generate random sequences of words from the picture.\n",
