# Way of work
1. Every task will be assigned and tracked by github issues.
2. Issues that require updates of the codebase will be resolved by PRs.
3. Name of each PR should be the same as the issue it tries to resolve (if there is no issue, name should be descriptive).
4. PRs require at least one approval, and all conversations resolved.
5. We have weekly meeting on Thursdays, 10:30 am with Murmuras team.
6. We name our files and folders using snake_case.
