\begin{abstract}
In the era of rapidly evolving digital applications, traditional scraping techniques face increasing challenges in maintaining reliable data collection pipelines. Commissioned by Murmuras, a company specializing in commercial and scientific data analysis, in this project we present two novel approaches to processing phone screen content, such as displayed social media posts and website advertisements. Our solutions leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) running locally on the user's device to handle diverse data formats while ensuring that sensitive information remains protected. The primary application explored in this study is the extraction of discount coupons, demonstrating the feasibility of our methods in identifying and structuring valuable content from varying digital sources. Furthermore, these systems are designed to be easily adaptable to other use cases, such as analyzing users' political views. Additionally we explore usage of non-LLM models for the defined task. The results highlight the potential of LLM-driven content analysis as an alternative to conventional scraping techniques.

\chapter{Introduction}

\section{Project background and motivation}
With the rapid advancement of information technology, the Internet has become one of the most crucial facets for many businesses to perform marketing activities \cite{design_of_coupons}. One of the key marketing tools in business-to-consumer (B2C) e-commerce is the digital coupon \cite{targeted_reminders}. Compared to paper coupons, digital coupons are characterized by their wide reach, rapid distribution, and low spread costs. Furthermore, a key advantage of digital coupons is their ability to facilitate targeted marketing by offering personalized discounts to different customers, thereby increasing sales \cite{design_of_coupons}.

Recent statistics underscore the significance of mobile devices in the domain of coupon distribution. For example, studies have shown that over 90\% of digital coupon users access their vouchers via smartphones \cite{emarketer_coupon_stats}, and similar figures are reported by other industry sources \cite{coupon_stats_2}. This high rate of mobile usage creates a pressing need for coupon analysis tools that are optimized for mobile platforms, ensuring that consumers receive timely and personalized offers regardless of their location or device.

Large Language Models (LLMs) have become a fundamental technique in contemporary machine learning \cite{LLM-popularity}, replacing previously utilized recurrent neural network (RNN) architectures in the field of natural language processing (NLP) \cite{li2024}. Subsequent research \cite{sui2024} has demonstrated their applicability to structured input data, such as screen views and coupons. Additionally, there have been efforts to integrate these models into web scraping pipelines \cite{scapegraph_repo}.

In light of these trends, the company Murmuras has tasked us with developing a solution based on a machine learning model that can be deployed as a mobile application. In response, we proposed two solutions: one utilizing two BERT \cite{BERT_intro} models, and the second one using one Llama model. Both approaches will process input representing the user's onscreen view and extract digital coupons along with their relevant data. Thess solutions must be capable of running locally on the device, ensuring efficient processing without relying on external servers. By leveraging advanced machine learning techniques, the app will handle the diverse formats and layouts of digital coupons, thus facilitating the collection of data regarding coupons.

\section{The definition of a coupon}
A coupon is a physical piece of paper or digital voucher that can be redeemed for a financial discount when purchasing a product \cite{coupon_definition}. A coupon is characterized by a name, expiration date, and a discount type, e.g. \emph{20\% off}, \emph{buy 1 get 1 free}, etc., however, not every coupon contains each of these features. Furthermore, coupons may contain numerous other features such as images and eligibility requirements. Henceforth, the term \emph{coupon} will refer exclusively to a digital coupon. The term \emph{conventional coupon} will refer to the traditional physical coupon. Examples of digital coupons encountered in mobile applications are presented in \ref{fig:example_coupons}

\end{figure}

\section{The Significance of the Digital Coupon}
The digital coupon is one of the most important tools in contemporary marketing strategies \cite{targeted_reminders}, therefore analyzing their lifecycle is essential to maximize their benefits. To facilitate such analyses, researchers collect various statistical metrics, including the fraction of redeemed coupons among all distributed coupons referred henceforth as \emph{redemption rate} \cite{danaher2015} and customer engagement \cite{jayadharshini2023}, while also assessing their impact on sales performance \cite{jayadharshini2023}.  Additionally, studying competitor's digital coupon strategies enables businesses to identify market trends, adjust their promotional tactics, and maintain a competitive edge in the evolving digital marketplace.

\section{Murmuras approach}
The measurement of statistics such as coupon redemption rates is primarily based on either survey data \cite{nayal2021} or controlled experimental studies \cite{danaher2015}. However, the company Murmuras \cite{murmuras} has introduced an alternative approach. By paying users to install tools for tracking their screen activity, and to share this data, Murmuras is able to directly collect coupon-related data from users' devices. Having access to the real-time access to the contents of the user's screen, Murmuras can gather data using screen content scraping tool, that can be later used to calculate coupon redemption rates but also the percentage of users that were presented with specific coupons and many more. This allows for large-scale acquisition of real-world data.

\section{Problem Statement}

The objective of this work is to extract coupons visible to the user from the content displayed on a mobile device screen. The extracted coupons should be represented as a JSON list, with each entry conforming to the following format:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item PRODUCT-NAME: the name of the product,
       \item ACTIVATION-TEXT: some coupons can contain text that informs us whether the coupon was activated or not.
        This can be used to calculate the popularity of a specific coupon.
    \item DISCOUNT-TEXT: the text representing the discount offered to the user,
    \item VALIDITY-TEXT: text specifying the expiration date of the coupon.
\end{enumerate}
We allow for special \textit{null} value in the above fields in case no data is available. An example of a digital coupon represented in JSON format is shown in listing \ref{lst:coupon_example}.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=json, caption={Example of a digital coupon in JSON format}, label={lst:coupon_example}]
{
    "PRODUCT-NAME": "Shampoo X",
    "ACTIVATION-TEXT": "Coupon activated",
    "DISCOUNT-TEXT": "20% OFF",
    "VALIDITY-TEXT": "Valid until 2025-06-30"
}
\end{lstlisting}

The screen content is provided in the form of a \texttt{.CSV} file, which encodes an XML tree structure representing the underlying screen layout. Each row in this file corresponds to a single view element within the screen hierarchy~\cite{android_view}. The dataset includes at least the following attributes:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{view\_depth}: The depth of the view within the XML tree hierarchy;
    \item \textbf{text}: The textual content displayed to the user within the view;
    \item \textbf{id}: A unique identifier for a screen sample. Each sample consists of a set of views observed either simultaneously or in directly consecutive snapshots;
    \item \textbf{time}: The timestamp indicating when the view was recorded;
    \item \textbf{view\_id}: The unique identifier assigned to the view by the Android API.
\end{enumerate}

An example of the dataset to illustrate described format is provided in Table~\ref{tab:dataset_example}.

\begin{table}[h]
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|}
        \hline
        \textbf{view\_depth} & \textbf{text} & \textbf{id} & \textbf{time} & \textbf{view\_id} \\
        \hline
        2 & "50\% OFF" & 101 & 12:30:15 & \texttt{com.example.app:id/discount\_label} \\
        3 & "Buy 1 Get 1 Free" & 101 & 12:30:15 & \texttt{com.example.app:id/promo\_banner} \\
        2 & "Limited Offer" & 102 & 12:31:05 & \texttt{com.example.app:id/offer\_text} \\
        \hline
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{Example of dataset format representing screen content.}
    \label{tab:dataset_example}
\end{table}

\section{Project goals}
The system will leverage machine learning to identify and structure relevant information while ensuring compatibility with mobile devices for enhanced accessibility and data privacy. The key goals of the project are as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item A tool to process the data extracted from the device into a format suitable for use by the model;
    \item A machine learning tool for extracting the data that is of interest to us, such as the coupon name, expiration dates, prices, etc. This tool should be capable of handling various coupon formats and layouts with high accuracy;
    \item A pipeline for preparing the input data for the previously mentioned tool, and for post-processing its output into a common format;
    \item A key requirement is that the machine learning model must be deployable on the mobile device itself. By performing the inference locally, and sending only results of this inference to the server, we guarantee the data privacy.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Potential applications of the project}

\subsection{Market analysis and competitor monitoring}
Machine learning is proven to be a useful tool in the field of market competitors analysis but it requires significant amounts of data\cite{competitor_tariffs}.
The aforementioned gathering of data about displayed coupons can be utilized in monitoring of competitors' coupon strategies, their effectiveness, and whether they provide better discounts. As an example, many online shops function as resellers of different brands. By analyzing coupons of these brands, they can decide which products needs additional marketing and/or discounts. Using machine learning to identify and analyze competitors' strategies is more cost-effective compared to exhaustive web scraping or mystery shopping \cite{competitor_tariffs}. This will enable businesses to make better informed decisions about their own marketing campaigns and provide a comprehensive understanding of the competitive landscape.

\subsection{Acquiring of data for research purposes}
In the age of smartphones and ubiquitous internet, more and more resources are being invested in research regarding social impacts of those technologies. One of many aspects of our social life is shopping. With a tool that can collect data about the presence and popularity of different coupons without depending on the publisher of those, it will be much easier and faster for researchers to gather real-world data regarding e.g. customer habits or the percentage of coupons that an average user clicks.

\section{Work structure}
In the next chapters, we first describe dangers related to the use of AI, focusing on privacy and environmental concerns. Then, we take a look at approaches similar to ours, that not necessarily utilize LLMs. After that, we describe datasets we used in our work, as well as technologies used in our experiments. Finally, we describe both our approaches, and summarize the whole project.

% \subsection{Benchmark}
% Benchmarking is the process of running a set of, among others, computer programs against a set of tests to assess their relative performance or precision % \cite{benchmark}.

Over the past several years, artificial intelligence (AI) has been widely discussed in the media. Amid the promises of an utopian future, with self-driving cars and intelligent virtual assistants that dominate the headlines, concerns about AI are also growing. Many fear a future in which human labour has been made obsolete by automation and AI \cite{francuz_1}. Privacy concerns are also mounting, as AI models are often trained on vast datasets that may include sensitive information such as healthcare records, biometric data for facial recognition, and financial details — sometimes collected without consent \cite{ibm_privacy}.Furthermore, the increasing integration of AI capabilities into a wide range of applications raises doubts about the security of our communications, particularly with respect to the reliability of End-to-End encryption \cite{E2EE}. In this chapter, we first describe differences between Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning and Deep Learning. Then, we describe details of the transformer's architecture, utilized by us in our solutions. Finally, we look into the potential privacy issues related to the usage of AI models, as well as the environmental concerns related to training of such models.


\section{Understanding the difference artificial intelligence, machine learning and deep learning}
AI, machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) are terms often mistakenly used interchangeably to refer to the development of systems capable of performing tasks typically requiring human intelligence such as decision making and speech recognition \cite{ibm_ai}. AI is the umbrella term encompassing among others, machine learning and deep learning, as well as other approaches \cite{francuz_2}. Machine learning is a subset of AI, in which systems are able to learn and adapt without explicit rules \cite{ibm_ai}. Deep learning is a type of machine learning utilizing neural networks. This hierarchy is depicted on the figure \ref{fig:hierarchy-ai-ml-dl}.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{nvidia_ai_hierarchy.png}
    \caption{The hierarchy of artificial intelligence, machine learning and deep learning \cite{nvidiaimage}}
    \label{fig:hierarchy-ai-ml-dl}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Artificial Intelligence}
Artificial intelligence can be succinctly described as "the effort to automate intellectual tasks normally performed by humans." The field of AI encompasses various approaches, including machine learning and deep learning, which rely on data and statistical models to identify patterns and make decisions. However, the field also includes symbolic AI, which operates differently by relying solely on predefined rules rather than data-driven models \cite{francuz_2}. An example of symbolic AI is expert systems like MYCIN\cite{mycin}, which used around 500 of IF-THEN rules to diagnose bacterial infections and recommend treatments with accuracy on par with human specialists and better than general practitioners.

\subsection{Machine Learning}
On the other hand, machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence in which the machine is trained rather than explicitly programmed, by making inferences from the input data it is presented with \cite{francuz_3}. Two major types of machine learning are supervised and unsupervised learning.

Supervised learning refers to an approach that relies on labeled datasets to train or "supervise" the model. The model is provided with input data along with the correct output, allowing it to learn by example. The model analyzes the relationship between the input features and the ground truth, gradually improving its ability to make accurate predictions. For example, to train a model to extract relevant coupon information such as the product name, new price, discount type, etc, the model is provided with coupon text and the corresponding labels such as the ones visible on the figure \ref{list:input}.

Supervised learning is commonly used for tasks such as classification, where data is sorted into categories, and regression, where numerical values are predicted based on patterns in the data. This method is widely applied in real-world scenarios like email spam detection, image recognition, and sales forecasting.

In contrast, unsupervised learning involves the model analyzing and clustering unlabeled data to identify patterns without explicit guidance from the programmer or predefined labels—hence it is called unsupervised learning. Unsupervised learning can be used to identify groups of products often purchased together \cite{supervised_ibm}. One example of the unsupervised learning approach is Principal Component Analysis (PCA) \cite{PCA}, which is a dimensionality reduction technique. PCA works by transforming the data into a new coordinate system where the greatest variance lies along the first principal component, the second greatest variance along the second component, which is perpendicular to the first one, and so on. This reduces the number of dimensions while retaining the most important features of the data.

In this project, we primarily employ supervised learning to develop our solution. This choice is driven by the nature of the problem, which involves identifying coupons from a screen view presented as an XML tree and extracting relevant data from them. Since this task is essentially a classification problem — where the goal is to categorize elements rather than uncover hidden patterns or group data points — supervised learning is the most suitable approach. By leveraging labeled data, the model can effectively learn to recognize and extract the desired information with accuracy and efficiency.

\subsection{Deep Learning}
Deep learning is a subset of machine learning wherein multilayered neural networks, called deep neural networks, are utilized to learn increasingly meaningful representations with each successive layer as seen in ~\ref{fig:nn_simple}; each representation is increasingly different from the original and more useful to determining the result. Traditionally, while machine learning models focus on learning one or two layers of representations of the data \cite{francuz_8}, deep learning employs at least three layers, and typically hundreds or thousands of layers to train the models \cite{ibm_dl}.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{nn_simple.png}
    \caption{Data representations learned by a digit-classification model \cite{francuz_8}}
    \label{fig:nn_simple}
\end{figure}

The transformation implemented by a layer is defined (parametrized) by its \textit{weights}, which are numerical parameters. Learning involves adjusting these weights to ensure the network accurately maps inputs to their corresponding targets. A deep neural network can have millions of parameters, leading to complex interdependencies, since changing one parameter affects the others. To guide this process, a \textit{loss function} measures how far the network's predictions deviate from the expected results, providing a score that reflects its performance. Deep learning relies on using the loss score as feedback to adjust the network's weights, guided by the optimizer using the backpropagation algorithm. Initially, the weights are typically random, resulting in poor predictions and a high loss score. With each example, the optimizer tweaks the weights to reduce the loss. Repeating this process across many examples gradually minimizes the loss, producing a trained network that closely matches its target outputs. This process is exemplified in ~\ref{fig:nn_function} \cite{francuz_9}.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{nn_function.png}
    \caption{A visualization of how a Deep Learning model works \cite{francuz_9}}
    \label{fig:nn_function}
\end{figure}

The advancement of deep learning contributed to the development of generative AI such as ChatGPT as well as NLP, which enables machines understand and generate text and speech. This is useful for translations and extracting meaning from large quantities of data \cite{ibm_dl}.

\subsection{Transformers}
Transformers are deep learning models introduced in the 2017 paper "Attention Is All You Need" \cite{attention} by Vaswani et al., which have significantly impacted natural language processing and other sequential data tasks. Unlike traditional recurrent neural networks \cite{RNN}, transformers utilize self-attention mechanisms to process input data in parallel, enhancing efficiency and scalability. This architecture has become foundational in models like BERT, and GPT \cite{medium_t}. An example overview of this architecture can be seen on ~\ref{fig:transformers_fig}. For more technical details, please refer to the "Chapter 3" of the aforementioned paper.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{transformer_arch.png}
    \caption{Transformer Architecture \cite{attention}}
    \label{fig:transformers_fig}
\end{figure}

% \subsubsection{Attention and multi-head attention}
% The attention mechanism is the core innovation of transformers. It allows the model to weigh the importance of each word (or token) in a sequence with respect to every other word. This is done by computing a set of attention scores, which decide how much attention one word should pay to others in the sequence.
% Multi-head attention is a key component of transformer architectures, enabling models to focus on different parts of an input sequence simultaneously. It works by projecting the input data into multiple subspaces, each corresponding to a separate attention head. These heads independently process the data, capturing various relationships and features. The outputs are then concatenated and transformed to produce the final result \cite{attention}.
% This approach allows the model to attend to multiple aspects of the input, such as different positions or semantic relationships, enhancing its ability to understand complex patterns. For example, in natural language processing tasks, one attention head might focus on syntactic structures while another captures semantic nuances.
% By distributing the attention mechanism across multiple heads, transformers can efficiently process information in parallel, leading to improved performance in tasks like machine translation, text summarization, and language understanding \cite{medium_medium_t}.
% The relationship between attention and multi-head attention is depicted in figure ~\ref{fig:attention_fig}.

% \begin{figure}

%     \caption{Attention and multi-head attention \cite{attention}}
%     \label{fig:attention_fig}
% \end{figure}


\subsection{Quantization}
Quantization is a technique employed in many fields including machine learning, to reduce the precision of numerical representations within models, typically converting high-precision formats like 32-bit floating point (FP32) to lower-precision formats such as 8-bit integers (INT8). Using integer operations instead of floating-point reduces the computational and memory requirements during inference, thereby making it more efficient and faster, which is an essential benefit for real-time applications. Furthermore, quantization enables deployment on resource-constrained hardware such as smartphones and tablets, while also reducing power consumption due to lighter computational loads. Though this may slightly reduce model accuracy, the trade-off often proves worthwhile in practical applications \cite{ibm_quantization}.
The two most common quantization techniques are float32 $\rightarrow$ float16 and float32 $\rightarrow$ int8 \cite{quant_hf}.
\subsubsection{float32 $\rightarrow$ float16}
Performing quantization from float32 to float16 is relatively straightforward as both data types are represented in the same manner. Float32 has the following format:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item The most significant bit (MBS) represents the sign of the number, i.e. whether it is negative or positive.
	\item The next 8 bits represent the exponent.
	\item The remaining 23 bits, are the mantissa, i.e. the decimal.
\end{enumerate}

According to the IEEE Standard for Floating-Point Arithmetic (IEEE 754) \cite{IEEE754}, for 32 bits this format can represent numbers of which the absolute value lies between $1.18 * 10^{-38}$ and $3.40 * 10^{38}$. An example representation can be seen here on figure \ref{fig:float}.
When converting from float32 to float16, we just remove the last 13 bits of the mantissa, creating a rounding error, and “shrinks” the exponent to fit into 5 bits. This may create a float overflow error if the float32 number is greater than $ 6.55e^4$ \cite{quant_explained}.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=1.0\linewidth]{mantis.png}
    \caption{Example representation of float32 \cite{IEEE754}}
    \label{fig:float}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{float32 $\rightarrow$ int8}
This type of quantization is more complicated as an INT8 can only represent 256 values which is significantly less compared to the $ 2^{24} $  values represented by a float32. The idea of this quantization is to map float32 values into the int8 space using the affine quantization scheme: $ x = S * (x_q - Z) $.
\begin{enumerate}
	\item $ x $ is the float32 value to be quantized.
	\item  $ x_q $ is the quantized int8 value associated with $ x $. It can be computed as follows $ x_q = round(x/S + Z) $.
	\item $ S \in float32$ is the scale.
	\item $ Z $ is the zero-point, which is the int8 value that corresponds to 0 in the float32 range \cite{quant_hf}.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Finetuning}
Fine-tuning is a specialized form of transfer learning that involves adapting a pre-trained model to perform a specific task, such as identifying coupons or extracting relevant information from them, rather than identifying all kinds of objects. Instead of training a model from scratch, fine-tuning starts with a model already trained on a large dataset and further trains it using a smaller, task-specific dataset. Attempting to train a large model from scratch on a small dataset can lead to overfitting, where the model performs well on training data but generalizes poorly to unseen data. Such approach is particularly beneficial for deep learning models, such as LLMs in natural language processing or convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in computer vision, as it reduces the computational resources and labeled data required \cite{ibm_finetuning}.
Fine-tuning consists of the following steps:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Training a source model on a large, general-purpose dataset. This enables the model to learn broadly useful feature representations.
	\item Construct a new target model by copying the architecture and parameters of the source model, excluding its final output layer. The retained parameters are presumed to encode transferable knowledge, while the output layer—being specific to the source dataset —is discarded.
	\item Introduce a new output layer tailored to the target task, ensuring it matches the number of classes in the target dataset. Initialize this layer’s parameters randomly.
	\item Train the target model on the new, task-specific dataset, e.g., a dataset of coupons. The new output layer is trained from scratch, while the remaining layers are fine-tuned using the pre-trained weights as a starting point \cite{finetune_cool_image}.
\end{enumerate}

% Benchmarking is the process of running a set of, among others, computer programs against a set of tests to assess their relative performance or precision \cite{benchmark}. Benchmarks are employed to evaluate and quantify the efficiency, accuracy, speed, and other metrics of a machine learning model or pipeline, thereby enabling the selection of the best overall solution to our problem.

\section{Should We Be Afraid of AI? Assessing the Risks and Ethical Implications of Artificial Intelligence}

% nie wydaje mi się że pisanie o adversarial attacks czy accuracy concerns w tym miejscu jest potrzebne. adversarial attacks bo nie robimy czegos co moze byc tak wykorzystane. accuracy bo bedziemy o tym pisać w kolejnych sekcjach i nie ma co od razu kota z worka wyciągać

As artificial intelligence becomes increasingly complex and integrated into our daily lives, the voices raising concerns about its dangers grow louder. Some express concern about the risks of excessive surveillance and privacy erosion, envisioning a future where AI systems are deeply intertwined with our surroundings, essentially hearing what we hear and seeing what we see \cite{not_sroka_vid, ai_scare2, ai_scare3}. Others highlight the environmental challenges tied to large-scale AI deployment, such as rising energy and water consumption, along with the need for rare materials in microchip production \cite{ai_env_concerns}. This section will focus on assessing the risks of artificial intelligence and how our solution will take them into account.

\subsection{Privacy Erosion}
AI systems heavily rely on vast amounts of user data to deploy machine learning techniques that identify subtle patterns and behaviors that may not be immediately evident, thus enabling personalized recommendations \cite{data_guard}. Social media platforms like TikTok exemplify this, as their algorithms suggest content based on users' previous interactions \cite{it_convergence} \cite{builtin}. While this personalization enhances user engagement, it also risks influencing people's opinions and shaping their worldview by trapping them in ideological echo chambers\cite{echo_chambers}. Consequently, \emph{information privacy} is one of the primary concerns surrounding the use of AI. \emph{Information privacy} refers to the protection of personal data that is being collected, processed and stored by AI systems \cite{transcend}. Training machine learning models typically requires immense datasets, involving terabytes or even petabytes of information. Therefore, these training sets likely include sensitive user information such as healthcare records and biometric data \cite{ibm_vast_data}. Beyond explicit data collection, AI systems can also infer highly personal attributes, such as political beliefs, sexual orientation, or health conditions, from seemingly unrelated data — a phenomenon known as \emph{predictive harm} \cite{transcend}. This information can be utilized to subject individuals to targeted advertising, unwanted profiling, and even identity theft, often without the user’s consent or awareness \cite{data_guard}, thus posing a serious privacy risk.

Moreover, AI systems can pose \emph{autonomy harms}, wherein the insights derived from data are used to influence individuals' decisions or behavior without their knowledge or proper consent. The common mindset of having "nothing to hide" overlooks the broader implications of these practices, which can undermine personal freedom and informed decision-making. A significant example of this problem is the Facebook-Cambridge Analytica scandal, in which a seemingly benign personality quiz was utilized to harvest over 87 million Facebook users’ data. Based on this data, detailed psychological profiles were constructed and leveraged to target individuals with personalized political ads during the 2016 US Presidential Election. This case underscores how AI can extract deeply personal insights from mundane user interactions, demonstrating the potential for misuse when data privacy protections are inadequate \cite{transcend}.

To address privacy concerns associated with AI systems, we are implementing locally-deployable models that process data directly on users' devices. This ensures that raw, unprocessed information never leaves the device or gets transmitted to external servers. By keeping data local, we significantly reduce the risk of unauthorized access, data breaches, or misuse. This approach empowers users with greater control over their information while still benefiting from the capabilities of AI in a secure and privacy-conscious manner.

\subsection{Environmental Concerns}
AI has a notable carbon footprint due to its increasing energy consumption, particularly during model training and usage \cite{forbes_dl_env}. One study predicts that by 2027, AI-related energy consumption could reach 85–134 TWh \cite{this_study}, representing nearly 0.5\% of today's global electricity usage. This estimate is based on the energy consumption of the Nvidia A100 servers~\mbox{-} the hardware estimated to be used by 95 percent of the AI market, and their projected sales in the upcoming years \cite{nyt_el}. Training LLMs typically requires significantly more energy in comparison to making a single prediction on the trained model \cite{sci_dir_comp}, for instance BERT required "the energy of a round-trip transcontinental flight" to train, while GPT-3 emitted 552 metric tons of carbon dioxide which is "the equivalent of 123 gasoline-powered passenger vehicles driven for one year" \cite{sci_am_co2}.

Furthermore, while a quarter of the world lacks access to clean water and sanitation, data centers consume significant quantities of water during their construction and during operation to cool electrical components \cite{first}. AI server cooling requires up to 9 liters of water per kWh of energy used. Given the amount of energy required to train and operate a model, this will exacerbate the lack of water, with UN estimates stating that by 2030 half of the world’s population will be facing severe water stress \cite{water_scarcity}. It is estimated that globally, infrastructure related to AI will soon require six times more water than Denmark \cite{first}.

In our approach, we opted to fine-tune existing language models rather than train new ones from scratch, a decision driven by both computational efficiency and environmental considerations. As highlighted by Wang et al. (2023)\cite{finetuning_env_good}, pre-training a model like BERT can require the equivalent energy of anywhere from 400 to 45,000 fine-tuning runs, depending on the dataset size. Their analysis shows that the number of training tokens is a reliable heuristic for estimating energy use during fine-tuning, and that sequence length significantly impacts energy intensity during this phase. These findings emphasize the substantial energy and carbon costs associated with pre-training, underscoring the environmental benefits of leveraging pre-trained models for downstream tasks.


\chapter{Related problems}
To the best of our knowledge, at the time of commissioning of this project, no publicly available solutions directly addressed this problem. The most comparable approaches involve existing multimodal models. While widely used models such as ChatGPT and Gemini provide general data extraction capabilities~\cite{brinkmann2023}, they are unsuitable for our task due to their substantial computational requirements. A key limitation of these models is their large size—for example, GPT-3 consists of 175 billion parameters\cite{chatgpt_params}—rendering them impractical for deployment on mobile devices~\cite{LinguaLinked}.

Alternatively, computer vision models can be used to extract text and bounding boxes from screen images. Microsoft’s OmniParser~\cite{omniparser_intro}, for instance, has demonstrated strong performance on the ScreenSpot dataset~\cite{omniparser_intro, cheng2024}. However, the challenge of organizing extracted text into structured coupon data renders this approach unsuitable for our study. Furthermore, our experiments with running OmniParser locally on example images indicate that it relies on CUDA technology, making it impractical for deployment on mobile devices.

\section{Murmuras' existing solution}
Murmuras' current approach relies on a set of fixed scrapping programms tailored to specific layouts from limited set of applications, making it inflexible and expansive to generalize across diverse coupon formats. This lack of adaptability limits its usefulness in real-world scenarios where coupon structures vary widely. Since our goal is to develop a solution that is easily adaptable for processing diverse mobile content, this method is not well-suited for our needs.

In contrast, Murmuras' most-recent proof of concept involves wrapping the \texttt{CSV} data with a prompt that instructs the model and sending it to GPT-4o-mini. This approach leverages an LLM to interpret the data to extract relevant coupon details. However, the reliance on an external server means the solution does not run locally on the mobile device, leading to potential privacy concerns, latency issues, and a dependence on internet connectivity.

\section{Web scraping}
With XML tree structure being similar to the HTML tree, our problem can be seen as one from web scraping domain. Web scraping \cite{WS} is a process of extracting data from a website. This usually involves downloading its HTML code, and parsing its structure.

\subsection{Code-based scraping}
A common approach to this problem would be writing code that would first download the HTML page and then parse it. Over the years, many libraries were created for this task, such as BeautifulSoup4 \cite{zupa}. It was written on top of HTML and XML parser, making it easy for user to reference specific fields by their ids, classes or HTML tags. From our perspective however, this solution has one mayor drawback: it's very difficult to scale it for multiple sources. Usually, scrapers of this type are being made for a specific site. With each shopping application/website having a different coupon format, it would be impossible to extend our solution for more that few data sources.

\subsection{AI-based scraping}
Since the public release of ChatGPT-3.5 in 2022, chat-based models came a long way. From the scraping perspective, one of the most useful addition is an option to attach files into the conversation, instead of having to copy-paste them into the chat. This functionality is supoorted by e.g. ChatCPG and DeepSeek \cite{DS}. However, from the perspective of our problem, this solution has a drawback of not being automatable.

ChatGPT seems to counter this issue. With OpenAI API \cite{OAPI} available, programmers can easily write Python code that will request LLM responses to their queries. It also provides much more customizability of the query than the chat, having e.g. an option to specify the model role, response length etc. This service was even used in the Murmuras PoC solution. The main problem with this approach is its price. Requests performed through the API require OpenAI credits, which have to be purchased with real money. So while its a cheap option for testing ideas, production usage would prove to be too costly for a company such as Murmuras.

To reiterate, it is important to notice, that even without the described issues, this approach would not be suitable for us, because those mentioned models are running on ontside servers. Sending them data to analyze would compromise data privacy, which is on of our main concerns.

\subsection{Scapegraph AI}
ScrapeGraphAI\cite{scapegraph_repo} is an open-source library that streamlines data extraction from websites and local documents by utilizing LLMs and graph logic to construct scraping pipelines. The library supports integration with various LLMs, including local models through the use of Ollama \cite{ollama_repo, scapegraph_usage}.

However, Scrapepraph AI provides only Python and Node.js SDKs \cite{scapegraph_sdks}, which could prove to be an issue with regard to mobile deployment, because neither Python nor Node.js is natively supported on iOS or Android \cite{android_dev_site, ios_dev_site}.

Moreover, due to mobile devices typically having limited processing power and memory compared to desktop computers or servers \cite{mobile_resources}, we cannot solely rely on the size of the model in order to improve performance. We believe that through fine-tuning LLMs, we are able to develop tools that are far more viable for edge device usage.

\chapter{Description of datasets}
\section{Raw datasets}
We received datasets corresponding to six different mobile applications: Edeka, Rossmann, DM, Rewe, Lidl, and Penny. Each dataset was provided as a CSV file containing XML representations of the data captured from the device interface during user interactions with the respective app. The selection of these applications, as well as the data collection and processing procedures, were carried out by Murmuras.

For each application, two key files were provided: the \textit{content\_generic} CSV file, which contains screen-captured data in XML format (see ~\ref{tab:csv_raw_cg}), and the \textit{coupons} CSV file, which serves as the ground truth (see ~\ref{tab:csv_raw_coupons}). The latter includes the coupons that our solution is expected to identify, along with the specific information that should be extracted from them.

We have streamlined the tables by removing the columns that were deemed unnecessary for our project, as their inclusion would have added excessive complexity without providing relevant value.

\section{Dataset Formats}
We preprocess the raw data to ensure it is structured in a manner that can be effectively utilized by the models.

\subsection{BERT Datasets}
The BERT models accept two dataset formats:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Plain format:} This format consists of raw, concatenated texts extracted from the `text` field in the \texttt{content\_generic} CSV file.
    \item \textbf{XML Tree format:} This format encodes the data from the \texttt{content\_generic} CSV file into an XML tree structure, which is then represented in JSON format, as shown in ~\ref{fig:json_example_xml_tree}.
\end{enumerate}

\chapter{Technologies}

\section{General}

The main platforms used during the development process were Hugging Face\cite{hugging-face} and GitHub\cite{github}. Hugging Face served as a hub for accessing models, as well as storing and managing both their trained versions and datasets used in training. During development, we also made extensive use of several Python libraries provided by Hugging Face, including \textit{datasets}\cite{lhoest2021datasetscommunitylibrarynatural}, \textit{transformers}\cite{wolf-etal-2020-transformers}, and \textit{evaluate}\cite{evaluate}. GitHub, in turn, offered version control for our code and documentation, and supported DevOps tasks such as issue tracking and automated unit testing.

Python\cite{python} was the primary programming language used, due to its broad support for machine learning workflows. Additionally, some auxiliary experiments related to Android deployment were conducted using Kotlin\cite{kotlin, service_demo_app_repo}.

\section{LLaMA Proposal}

Our first solution was based on the LLaMA architecture and utilized a custom fine-tuned version of LLaMA-3.2-1b provided by Meta\cite{meta-llama}. Fine-tuning was performed using the Unsloth\cite{unsloth} tool, which enabled efficient resource usage. Specifically, Unsloth applied the LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) fine-tuning technique\cite{hu2021loralowrankadaptationlarge}, reducing the number of trainable parameters to approximately 10 million. It also facilitated easy model conversion to the GGUF format.

The fine-tuning process was carried out on the Modal platform\cite{modal}, which allowed us to define execution environments directly in Python and execute code on cloud infrastructure equipped with H100 GPUs. Training progress and logs were monitored using Weights \& Biases (Wandb)\cite{wandb}.

Model inference was conducted using the Llama.cpp\cite{llama-cpp} tool, utilizing the model converted to the GGUF format.

\section{BERT Proposal}

The second approach—a two-stage BERT pipeline—was also trained on the Modal platform. Logging and experiment tracking were similarly managed using Wandb.

\section{Auxiliary Experiments}

Additional experiments conducted as part of this project involved frameworks such as SpaCy\cite{spacy, spacy-exp} and Scrapegraph AI, as well as mobile deployment tools including ONNX\cite{onnx, onnx-exp}, liteRT\cite{lite-rt, lite-rt-exp}, and Executorch\cite{executorch, executorch-exp}. These experiments were conducted using Android Studio\cite{android-studio, service_demo_app_repo} and Jupyter notebooks\cite{jupyter}, running in an IPython\cite{ipython} environment.


\chapter{BERT 2-stage architecture overview}
Our proposed solution addresses the problem by framing it as a Named Entity Recognition (NER) task and employing a pipeline of two BERT models. Introduced by Google in 2018~\cite{BERT_intro}, BERT has become a standard in NLP. As of 2025-04-04, it ranks as the fourth most downloaded model on HuggingFace~\cite{BERT_hf}. The base model contains 110 million parameters, and its output format is well-suited for token classification — this combination was the primary reason for choosing it.

In our approach, inspired by region proposal networks in computer vision~\cite{Region_proposal}, two BERT models were used. The first one identifies coupon regions, while the second extracts their attributes.

\section{2-stage architecture}
Figure \ref{fig:zpp} represents the general structure of the system. It consists of:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Input Data} (See~\ref{list:sel-input}):
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Each frame captured by the user's phone is stored as an XML tree
        \item XML data is flattened into a CSV file, where entries from the same frame share a timestamp value
        \item All text data from a frame is concatenated (grouped by timestamp) and fed into the model
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Selection Pass}:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item First multilingual BERT model performs NER
        \item Tags tokens as either \texttt{COUPON} or \texttt{UNKNOWN} in IOB2 format~\cite{iob2}
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Selection Pass Output}:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Labeled tokens are reassembled into contiguous strings (grouping adjacent tokens with the same label)
        \item Only text segments labeled \texttt{COUPON} are forwarded to the next stage
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Extraction Pass}:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Second multilingual BERT model processes the filtered input
        \item Performs fine-grained NER to classify tokens into four fields representing out data model (see \ref{lst:coupon_example})
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Pipeline Output}:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Tokens are concatenated into strings based on their field labels
        \item Results are packaged into JSON objects
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\section{BERT family of models}
The widespread adoption of BERT~\cite{BERT_hf} has led to numerous architectural variants. Beyond the larger BERT-Large (around 300M parameters) and multilingual adaptations, efforts have focused on enhancing performance, e.g. RoBERTa~\cite{RoBERTa}, which outperforms vanilla BERT through extended pretraining and improving efficiency, e.g. ALBERT~\cite{ALBERT}, which reduces parameters to  around 12M~\cite{ALBERT_hf}.
Additionally, during our research, ModernBERT~\cite{ModernBERTPaper} was released, offering advancements such as extended context length of 8,192 tokens, faster inference, and superior performance on benchmark tasks. On top of that, it was still comparable with the base model, having around 150M parameters~\cite{ModernBERThf}.
After evaluating these variants, we selected the BERT-base multilingual model with 179M parameters~\cite{BERT_multiling}. This decision was driven mostly by the fact that all of the other mentioned models lacked multilingual support, making BERT-base really the only model that would only require fine-tunings on our data to work.

\section{Fine Tuning}
We implemented independent training for both BERT models in our pipeline. This approach provides several key advantages:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Isolated Error Penalization}: Each model is only penalized for its own mistakes during training. Joint training could distort the selection model's loss function due to errors propagating from the extraction pass.

    \item \textbf{Data Integrity}: The extraction model trains on accurate intermediate representations, preventing potential bias from the selection model's imperfect predictions during joint training.

    \item \textbf{Practical Benefits}:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Simplified implementation, compared to end-to-end training
        \item Greater control over each model's learning process
        \item Easier hyperparameter tuning for individual components
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

This modular training strategy ensures both models reach their optimal performance without compromising each other's learning objectives.
\subsection{Fine-tuning methodology}
Both selection and extraction models were trained on a dataset comprising data from four retail applications: DM, Lidl, Rewe, and Rossmann. The dataset was split 80\%--20\% for training and testing respectively, following common practice~\cite{pp}, with evaluation performed after each epoch. All fine-tuning experiments were conducted under the assumption that final model performance would be benchmarked on separate datasets from Edeka and Penny applications to maintain independence between training and evaluation data.
In total, we conducted four different experiments:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{General Fine-tuning}:

    Main goal of this experiment was to establish baseline performance metrics. Additionally, this experiment was used as a basis to abandon
    Curriculum learning and JSON format approaches. It was conducted by fine-tuning models on combined data from all four applications.

    \item \textbf{Per-application Fine-tuning}:

    In this experiment, we wanted to examine cross-application generalization capabilities of our pipeline. To do this, we fine-tuned individual models separately on each application's data, and then tested them on other applications to measure similarities between datasets. This measurement was based on how well model trained on app X behaves on test dataset containing data from all four apps.

    \item \textbf{Incremental Separate Fine-tuning}:

    This was the first of two experiments used to see, how easily our solution could be generalized/extended. To conduct it, we performed four consecutive fine-tunings on each model:

    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Base model fine-tuned only on DM data
        \item Subsequent fine-tuning on Lidl data
        \item Additional fine-tuning on Rewe data
        \item Final fine-tuning on Rossmann data
    \end{enumerate}
    This way, we were able to see whether models gain more knowledge when presented with new sources of data or they loose it.

    \item \textbf{Incremental Combined Fine-tuning}:

    Idea behind our last experiment was similar to the Incremental Separate Fine-tuning, but this time we were adding new data to the training dataset, instead of changing them. This was intended as a way to prevent models from forgetting previously learned patterns. For that, we performed the following fine-tunings:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Initial fine-tuning on DM data only
        \item Subsequent fine-tuning on combined DM + Lidl data
        \item Additional fine-tuning on DM + Lidl + Rewe data
        \item Final fine-tuning on all four applications' data
    \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Selection pass specifics}
Beyond the basic fine-tuning approach, we conducted two additional experiments with the selection pass model:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{XML Tree Preservation}:

    When working with data grouped by timestamps, we loose the information about the relations between different elements on the user's screen. With XML tree preservation, we wanted to see if maintaining this information would improve coupon detection. To perform this experiment, we created special datasets, where screen content strings were wrapped in JSON structures simulating the XML hierarchy.

    Ultimately, we decided to abandon this approach for two reasons: first of all, it was performing worse than the original approach, called \emph{plain-text} (see plots \ref{fig:s_elg}, \ref{fig:e_epg}, \ref{fig:s_erg}). Second of all, wrapping everything in JSON structure introduced more text, which lead to bigger dataset sizes. As a result, fine-tunigs were longer and more costly, with no clear benefit.

    \item \textbf{Token Distribution Balancing}:

    First batches of data that we received from Murmuras had skewed data distribution. For many timestamps, only 10 \% of words contained in them were part of any coupon. As a result, models were not learning much, because labeling everything as UNKNOWN (not belonging to any coupon) was enough for more than 90 \% precision and recall. To counter this issue, we implemented a Curriculum Learning algorithm. The idea behind it was to first train models on datasets with manually balanced data distribution, and then, with more epochs, to increase the number of tokens that were not part of any coupon. Last epochs would be performed on the original dataset (see details in \ref{AppA}).

    At the end, this approach was also abandoned. Similarly, to the xml preservation, it was performing worse than the basic approach (see plots \ref{fig:s_elg}, \ref{fig:e_epg}, \ref{fig:s_erg}; models with "no-curr" are the ones fine-tuned without the curriculum learning). Additionally, later data batches from Murmuras were free from that flaw. Most of the timestamps had around 30 \% {-} 50 \% or more of words that were a part of some coupon.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Selection pass fine-tuning results}
General fine-tuning experiment demonstrated that a simple data representation without any class balancing yielded the best results, with the model without XML tree preservation and Curriculum learning reached 97 \% precision and almost 99 \% recall (see plots \ref{fig:s_elg}, \ref{fig:s_epg} and \ref{fig:s_erg}) As a consequence, we decided to abandon both the JSON format and the Curriculum Learning approach. Furthermore, subsequent experiments were conducted using 10 epochs instead of 30, as higher epoch counts led to increasing loss values for the base model.

For per-application fine-tuning, models generally performed poorly. Almost all models didn't suprass 20 \% in recall metric. An exception was the model trained on the Lidl dataset, with over 60\% recall (see plot \ref{fig:s_ers}).

In both incremental fine-tuning scenarios, although the model initially trained on DM data struggled with classification (almost 0 \% recall), further fine-tuning significantly improved its recall, with best result for separate fine-tunings being 72 \%  for Rossmann fine-tuning, and 87 \% in case of combined fine-tuning for also the Rossman fine-tuning. This suggests that it is possible to extend the model's functionality with minimal effort through simple fine-tuning (see plots \ref{fig:s_eras} and \ref{fig:s_erag}).

\section{Extraction pass fine-tuning results}
In the general fine-tuning setting, the extraction pass was learned smoothly. A potential concern, however, is the simultaneous increase in loss, recall, and precision, which may indicate slight overfitting (see plots \ref{fig:e_elg}, \ref{fig:e_epg}, \ref{fig:e_erg}).

The single-application experiment produced results similar to those observed in the selection pass. Once again, the model fine-tuned on Lidl dataset performed best, with 64 \% recall (see plot \ref{fig:e_ers}).

For both types of incremental experiments, the results closely mirrored those of the selection pass. For separate fine-tuning, Rossmann fine-tuning reached 95 \% recall, and for combined one, 99 \% recall. However, in this case, fine-tuning on the Lidl dataset led to even greater performance improvements, making additional fine-tuning less impactful. This indicates that with the right dataset, a relatively small amount of data may be sufficient to expand the model’s capabilities (see plots \ref{fig:e_eras}, \ref{fig:e_erag}).

\chapter{Curriculum Learning Approach} \label{AppA}

To address class imbalance in Murmuras-provided data and the JSON-based selection pass, we implemented a curriculum learning algorithm inspired by curriculum learning \cite{CurrLearn}. This approach mimics human learning progression by gradually increasing task difficulty:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Implementation}:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Initial training on balanced datasets (equal coupon/non-coupon examples)
        \item Progressive introduction of more non-coupon samples
        \item Gradual complexity increase mirroring human learning patterns
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Observed Advantages}:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Smoother, more stable loss descent during training
        \item Reduced overfitting compared to baseline approaches
        \item More predictable learning trajectory
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Performance Outcomes} \ref{fig:s_elg}, \ref{fig:s_epg}, \ref{fig:s_erg}:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Consistently inferior metrics (accuracy/recall) versus baseline
        \item 30-epoch evaluation showed no competitive improvement
        \item Final decision to exclude from production pipeline
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

Despite its theoretical benefits and training stability, the curriculum approach was ultimately abandoned as baseline methods demonstrated superior practical performance across all key metrics. This suggests that for our specific task and data characteristics, direct exposure to the true data distribution may be preferable to gradual introduction of complexity.

\chapter{BERT Selection pass JSON format} \label{AppB}

For the selection pass in our two-stage architecture, we evaluated two alternative data formats:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Plain format}: A direct representation of the textual screen content for each timestamp (Listing~\ref{list:sel-input})
    \item \textbf{JSON format}: An enriched representation that additionally encodes the XML tree structure of the Android screen content (Listing~\ref{list:sel-json})
\end{itemize}

Following comprehensive fine-tuning experiments, we discontinued the JSON format approach due to several factors:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Performance metrics during training were comparable to or worse than the curriculum learning approach
    \item The JSON structure increased token count, resulting in:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Longer training times
        \item Higher computational costs
    \end{itemize}
    \item The approach failed to deliver satisfactory improvements in model accuracy
\end{itemize}

The comparative results are presented in Figures~\ref{fig:s_elg}, \ref{fig:s_epg}, and~\ref{fig:s_erg}.
