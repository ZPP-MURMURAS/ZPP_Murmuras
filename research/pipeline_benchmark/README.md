### Pipeline benchmark
This benchmark is designed to compare the performance of different pipelines to provide a measurable way of selecting superior solutions. The pipelines are evaluated based on their accuracy in classifying coupons from a given XML tree. The benchmark is designed to be a fair comparison of the pipelines, and the results are used to determine the best pipeline for our task. \
Each pipeline will be rewarded accordingly based on the correctly classified coupons and penalized for incorrectly classified coupons. The benchmark will be run on a dataset of `x` XML trees and the corresponding coupons.
