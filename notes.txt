Description:
1. created a simple service that prints to logs the fibonacci numbers one by one; it runs in the background; this can be useful when debugging 
2. created a simple worker to compute a large number in the background
3. created a simple toast that shows up every 5 seconds (demonstrates the use of async)

The Android system stops a service only when memory is low and it must recover system resources for the activity that has user focus. If the service is bound to an activity that has user focus, it's less likely to be killed; if the service is declared to run in the foreground, it's rarely killed. If the service is started and is long-running, the system lowers its position in the list of background tasks over time, and the service becomes highly susceptible to killing—if your service is started, you must design it to gracefully handle restarts by the system. If the system kills your service, it restarts it as soon as resources become available, but this also depends on the value that you return from onStartCommand().
